# Error Analysis

Error_Analisys_R1 routine solves for the mean electrostatic potential for a single molecule in a continuus domain. Gives 
the error when calculating the Solvation energy. Must add references and some sort of demostration.

Error_2.0.vtk is the error estimation in the solvation energy by element, should be opened with Paraview.

Grid_Maker.py is a callable file to create the mesh. MSMS and NanoShaper allowed

quadrature.py contains functions to estimate boundary integrals
